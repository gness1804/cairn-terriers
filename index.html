        <h3>Meet the Cairn Terrier</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cairn-terrier/" target="_blank">Cairn Terriers</a> are a breed of dog originating in Scotland. They are small in size and known for their assertive, hardy, and independent demeanors. They tend to weigh 13-18 lb and their average lifespan is 10-13 years.</p>
        <p>Cairns are not for everyone: they are notoriously hard to train, require lots of exercise and attention, and require moderate amounts of grooming. But the reward for all this effort is a friend for life!</p>
        <p>Who is the best known Cairn Terrier of all time? Probably Terry, the dog who played Toto in <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i> Dorothy's delightful companion in this classic film showcases many of the key traits of Cairns: loyalty, affection, courage, and relentless spirit. According to Terry's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_(dog)" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>, the dog appeared in 16 movies over the span of its illustrious career.</p>

        <h3>Some Tips from a Veteran Cairn Terrier Owner</h3>
        <p>I have lived with 3 Cairn Terriers in my life (and 2 Westies, which are very similar to Cairns), so I know a thing or two about the breed. If you are a new owner to a Cairn or are considering adopting one, keep the following in mind:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cairns are high-energy, spirited dogs. Every dog has a different personality, but the breed in general is full of self-confidence and spunk. A Cairn owner needs to always ensure that he/she is in charge of his/her dog; Cairns are very loyal, but if you give them an inch, they will take a mile!</li>
          <li>Related to the above, Cairns need lots of exercise. If you want a dog that is fairly sedentary, the Cairn is not a good fit.</li>
          <li>Cairns take extra effort to train; they are not your Golden Retriever or German Shepherd. With patience and persistence, they can be trained to do many things, but their independent nature presents certain challenges.</li>
          <li>Cairns were bred to ferret out small rodents and game in rocky, hilly environments. As such, they are likely to dart after squirrels, birds, cats, or even cars, at least without rigorous training. Be sure to keep firm control over them while out and about, as their "rooting" instincts can put them in dangerous situations if the owner is not vigilant.</li>
          <li>Finally, have fun with them! A bored Cairn is an unhappy Cairn. (This is true of all dogs, but especially of highly active ones like Cairns.) Cairns love new adventures, but as noted above, they need firm and loving guidance!</li>
        </ul>
